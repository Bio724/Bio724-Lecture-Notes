## Getting help

## `man`
`man` (short for "manual") provides short and succinct description of various commands and program.

Examples:
  - `man ls`: read the manual pages for the `ls` command
  - `man man`: read the manual `man`

When read a man page you can use the arrow keys to move up/down line by line, `<space>`/`b` to advance/go back a page at a time,  and `q` to quit.

## `info`

`info` is another help program available on Unix systems built around the GNU core utilities.  `info` is typically wordier and more detailed and often includes examples of use.


Example:
- `info ls`: compare this to man `ls`

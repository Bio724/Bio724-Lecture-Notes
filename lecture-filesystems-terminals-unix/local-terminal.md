## Terminology

* A "terminal" is a text input/output environment for interacting with your computer. A terminal used to be a physical device attached to a computer. Strictly speaking, these days we run "terminal emulators" -- graphical programs that emulate terminals.
* A "shell" is a program that runs in a terminal that processes and interprets the command you type. You can run different shells in the same terminal.


## Mac OS

* Terminal accessed by running "Terminal" program (in the "Applications/Utilities" folder)
* Default shell is [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/); but bash also included by default (invoke at command line by typing `bash`)

## Windows

* Default terminal is "Command Prompt" but new "Windows Terminal" is better choice
* Several options for shell but I recommend "PowerShell"
